# Roadmap

This roadmap describes the steps we need to take to achieve the goals of the `Our Handbook` project. This roadmap includes changes that must be made in:
1. the [template repo], containing the `Our Handbook` **template**
2. the handbook repo: this repo, containining `Our Handbook` **handbook**, as well as organisational documents e.g. this roadmap.

Organisational documents are kept in the handbook repository (rather than the template repository), to keep the template repository as clean as possible, since it will be cloned by lots of people who don't care about how this project is organised.

Our roadmap is organised into GitHub Milestones, and the milestones are organised across the two repositories, such that issues/milestones that require edits to the template repo can be found on the template repo, while issues/milestones that require edits to the handbook repo can be found on the handbook repo.

## Milestone 1: Complete prototype
Milestone 1A: Prototype the `Our Handbook` template.
Milestone 1B: Prototype the `Our Handbook` handbook.

## Milestone 2: First user-test (me)

Milestone 2B: Update the `Our Handbook` template to include feedback from the first demo handbook
