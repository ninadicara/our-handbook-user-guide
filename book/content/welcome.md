Welcome to the Our Handbook project
===================================

This online book (powered by [Jupyter Book](http://jupyterbook.org/)) introduces the Our Handbook project, and helps you make use of the Our Handbook template.

## The Our Handbook project
The `Our Handbook` project is a set of open source resources to help you create a staff handbook with and for your research group, lab, or research software engineering team. 

We hope that research group leaders and members will work together using these resources to:
* build a healthy, inclusive, enjoyable research culture in their group 
* produce the most ethical and rigorous research possible

### The Our Handbook resources
We have two resources:
- A [template GitHub repository](https://github.com/very-good-science/our-handbook-template), which contains code and resources to help you create your own group handbook using Jupyter Book. 
- The Our Handbook user guide (you are here!) to help you make use of the template.

#### The [Template](https://github.com/very-good-science/our-handbook-template)
The main purpose of the Our Handbook template [repository](https://github.com/very-good-science/our-handbook-template) is to help you generate content and structure for your group handbook. For example, it contains fill-in-the-blanks and choose-your-own content, writing exercises for creating content, and some default resources (e.g. for running meetings and co-working sessions, or templates for project post-mortems).

```{margin} What do we mean "deploy" the book?
To make the handbook accessible online: we use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to do this. 
```

As a secondary purpose, the template repository contains all the infrastructure you need to edit your handbook using GitHub, including files that assist you in making the most out of GitHub to organise your new handbook:
- GitHub actions that automatically {ref}`"deploy"<define-deploy>` your book ) when you changes to it, i.e. when you push, or make a PR (Pull Request) to the `main` branch. 
- Issue templates, that help you quickly fill in what you and your team are planning on doing with your book.

Because this is all setup already, it also means that the template itself is deployed, too: so you can see how the base template (without any editing) looks online [here](https://very-good-science.github.io/our-handbook-template/).
The deployed template could be a little deceptive, however, because it obscures a lot of the content in comments, so the best way to get a really good idea of what is in the template is to read this user guide, or to look through the template repository on GitHub.

#### The Our Handbook user guidebook 
The Our Handbook user guidebook (you are here!) exists primarily to help you make the most of the template materials. 
It also acts as a "home page" for the project itself.

### Why should you create a group handbook?
There are lots of practical reasons why you might want to create a group handbook. You might want to use your handbook to ensure that:
* **Everyone knows how to access the available help and support**,  be it computational/statistical support, counselling, administrative/communications support, etc. By providing a one-stop-shop for up to date signposting of help and support available to group members, this is easier to access.
* **Everyone knows where they stand and what they need to do**: Responsibilities and expectations of group leaders and group members are explicit (e.g. "PhD students send a weekly email detailing their weekly progress using [this email template](resources/email-template.md)", or "Group leaders will be available for one-to-ones with each group member once per fortnight", or "It is Jennifer's (Group leader) responsibility to organise the group meetings, which happen twice monthly"). These expectations can be as broad, or exact as your group finds useful.
* **Standards for research outputs are clear**, e.g. "In this group, we make data [FAIR](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) wherever possible", or "We ensure privacy for research participants", **and the barriers to meeting these standards is as low as possible**, e.g. by including or linking to how-to-guides.
* **You can develop and showcase your research culture**: Group members can have agency to impact the research culture of the group through suggesting edits to the handbook, potential future group members can easily get a flavour of the research culture (the handbook is shared in job adverts), and it's easy to welcome them when they arrive as everything is in one place (in the handbook).
* **Everyone can learn from eachother**: Everyone knows who to go to to ask all kinds of questions (e.g. "Ask Katy about GitHub Actions", "Ask Matt about multilevel modelling", "Ask Jessica about contracts"), and where to find important documents (as they are linked to), and everyone has a place where they can share their knowledge of best practice to ensure that projects can persist beyond individual roles.

Your handbook can be used for as many or as few of these purposes as you like, but it should be a living document that the group continues to author together.

### Why should you use Our Handbook to make a group handbook?
This resource is designed to make it as quick, and automatic, to create and review this important document. 

It has the following useful features:
* Template handbook sections for you to mix, match, remix and edit to create the most useful handbook for your group in the shortest time.
* Template processes for running away days, team meetings, and more.
* Reduces the difficulty in maintaining your handbook, by providing testing and continuous integration, which:
  * Sets up your handbook as a GitHub Pages website to make it available to your team and others 
<!--  * Automatically checks links in your handbook are still working -->

### Why are we making these resources?
Research culture can sometimes be a bit of a hellscape (for everyone at all career levels):
* researchers and group leaders can often feel stressed, unsupported, and isolated
* a lack of guidance in how to do research can contribute to untrustworthy research outputs

A lot of this can come down to the research culture within a group. By research culture, we mean the often unspoken processes which impact both how it feels to work there and the quality of research outputs. There is little support for group leaders who wish to improve the research culture in their groups. We want to change that.

We hope that, by reducing the barriers for groups to consider their research culture, we will support group leaders in taking responsibility for it: to help them set standards for the quality of research that comes out of their group, and to create ways of working that protect the health and wellbeing of their group members and themselves. Your handbook might help you and your group in any of the [practical ways](#why-should-you-create-a-research-group-staff-handbook) described above.

In addition to the benefits to the research groups that are working this way, we also hope this will impact on broader research culture. We want to normalise the idea that spending some time to building a healthy research culture is worthwhile. We would love universities to consider commitment of researchers to creating a healthy research culture in hiring and promotion decisions.
